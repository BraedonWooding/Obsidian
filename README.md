# Obsidian - C testing framework

Just a testing framework built for C.

Check out the docs [here](https://braedonwooding.github.io/Obsidian)

Currently we don't support Windows for benchmarking child processes or system processes.  The APIs to do so aren't friendly and are prone to annoyances.  For example we need to fully qualify the path, amongst other things.  I'm going to look into it more once I'm done with CPath integration to Windows.  If in the meantime you wish to implement this please feel free :).
